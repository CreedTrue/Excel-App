Welcome to Excel Scrubber

This is still in the early stages. I only recently got around to messing with it.
I want to create an application to help scrub excel sheets for important info. This project is currently very specifically focused on a perticular job. I will be trying to make it more generally applicable to others as well.

Instructions:

1. Select the original excel file you will use.

2. Select a file to save it as. (WARNING: IF YOU USE THE SAME NAME AS THE ORIGINAL
 THEN IT WILL REPLACE IT INSTEAD OF CREATING A NEW ONE.)

3. Click on SCRUB IT!

4. Your scrubbed excel will be ready in a few seconds!
